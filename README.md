# taskManagerSetups

My personal boilerplates for Grunt and Gulp - used in past projects.

## About

The two setups contain both the `package.json` files, and the `Gruntfile` / `Gulpfile`, ad well as the general folder structure needed for the setups to work "out of the box". If alterations are made to the folder structures, it may require changes to the `Gruntfile` / `Gulpfile` as well.
